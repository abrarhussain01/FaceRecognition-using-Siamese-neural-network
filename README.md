# FaceRecognition-using-Siamese-neural-network
Implemented a Siamese Neural Network for face verification using TensorFlow. Built a custom CNN embedding model, distance layer, and training loop with tf.GradientTape. Evaluated using precision and recall, and documented limitations of CPU-only training with future GPU-based improvements.
